# HeSaysGif
Generate a speech bubble GIF from an image or GIF. This GIF file is currently saved on your Desktop folder, but I'm planning on having a configurable save path.

## CLI Usage
Once the program is extracted in binary form, you can run it with either:
1. No Args: Will prompt you to enter the path of the file
2. With File Path As Arg: Will do everything queitly

## GUI Usage
Run program. Click button. Select File. Done.

## Example

### Output
